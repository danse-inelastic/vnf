Perhaps the best way to do this is to copy only the explicitly CGI material into this directory and then search a third user's dv directory 
for pyre components.  The third user will be cgiGuy.

Instead of executing a quick shell script, environment variables for paths should be set another way, perhaps give cgiGuy control over all the
apache files (dangerous) or tinker with apache's environment variables (better idea).

For now, however, it would be best to search both Jiao's and Brandon's stuff (during testing phase) and copy 
content,
config,
sampleassemblies,
etc.
directly to the /usr/lib/cgi-bin. The contents of the html/ directory are copied to /var/www/apache2-default/
