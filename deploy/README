To deploy, make a link in 

  .../cgi-bin

name it "vnf", and link it to an appropriate directory here. 

For example, to deploy it in Jiao's account on a Mac OS X machine, do the following

 $ cd ~/Sites/cgi-bin
 $ ln -s ~/dv/danse/VNET/vnf/trunk/deploy/MacOSX/linjiao/cgi-bin vnf


Make another symbolice link in (sth similar to)

  /var/www

name it "vnf". The target would be the "html" directory of vnf.

 
Go to the root directory of vnf, and run mm
 
 $ cd ..../VNET/vnf/trunk
 $ mm
 $ cd deploy/...
 $ mm

Start services

 $ cd $EXPORT_ROOT/vnf/bin
 $ ./startservices.sh


Initialized database (one must run this script as the owner of the database)
 $ cd $EXPORT_ROOT/vnf/bin
 $ ./initdb.sh


Create ssh keys so that vnf can contact computation server.
 1. create a directory (to store ssh-related files). 
 1. create a private/public key pair and put them under that directory
 1. create an empty knownhosts file under that directory
 1. make changes to ssher.pml to reflect paths to above-mentioned files 
 1. add public key to the computation server's accepting account's
    .ssh/authorized_keys file
