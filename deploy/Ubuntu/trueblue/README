NOTE: the content directory is a link to the same-named 
directory under the main vnf directory (top-level directory).  To set up vnf 
using Brandon's configuration simply go to jbk/bin and ./startservices.sh.


here are some job building notes:

*to work on job submission, you will need to have a "job builder" and a "computation result retriever". 
*This is a good example: http://danse.us/trac/VNET/browser/vnf/trunk/vnf/components/ins/job_builders/BvKComputation.py
*another one is this: http://danse.us/trac/VNET/browser/vnf/trunk/vnf/components/job_builders/NeutronExperiment.py
*Say, for example, you have a computation that is described by table "Vasp". You will need to have a Vasp.py in one 
of the job_builders directories.
*implement a class "Builder". And it should have a method _init_ which takes a path to where the job files will be 
written and a method "render" which creates the input files in the init path and returns the input file names 
as a list.
*it must contain at least run.sh which will be called by sh.  the jobs should be put in a folder /content/data/jobs, 
this folder should not be committed to the repository.  
*on the job editing page (actor: Job, routine: view), the submit button will the start a process in the background 
and return a "job is being submitted page" and then the process in the background will copy the contents of 
this folder from vnf to octopod and start the job by calling a scheduler such as torque.
