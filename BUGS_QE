Bugs list for Quantum Espresso part of VNF
==========================================

- In "jobs/jobs-view-all" actor "Check" button retrieves results only for the first record in the table.
- Fix issue when pseudo-potential is not available for the atom element (e.g. Ce)
- Fix global pointer issue for simulation creation

- Progress bar checks non existing ID.
    In the middle of job submission (with progress bar) you click on any other link
