- [FIXED] In "jobs/jobs-view-all" actor "Check" button retrieves results only for the first record in the table.
- Fix issue when pseudo-potential is not available for the atom element (e.g. Ce)
- Fix global pointer issue for simulation creation
- Max number of generated k-points for phonon dispersion in matdyn task is 26x26x26.
  Figure out what causes the limitation. Extend to at least 64

    In the middle of job submission (with progress bar) you click on any other link
