Results Path
------------
There are two types of result paths: local and remote. Local result path is available
when results are retrieved to the local machine only.


Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics
---------------------------------

"NVT" - Canonical ensemble with Nose Thermostat. At this point Quantum Espresso
within VNF does not directly support variable-cell molecular dynamics (or stress
calculation) - "NPT". But you are still can do variable-cell molecular dynamics
by editing files appropriately.

In order to caclculate CP molecular dynamics simulation you need to bring your system. 
to a particular state. The following steps are implemented:

- Electronic Minimization (with Fixed Ions and Cells) # Essential

    restart_mode = 'from_scratch'   # SYSTEM
    electron_dynamics = 'sd'        # ELECTRONS
    ion_dynamics = 'none'           # IONS

Label: Electronic Minimization

Performs steepest descent electron dynamics

- Ion Minimization (with Damped Electron Dynamics and Fixed Cells)

    restart_mode = 'restart'        # SYSTEM
    electron_dynamics = 'damp'      # ELECTRONS
    electron_damping = 0.2
    ion_dynamics = 'damp'           # IONS
    ion_damping = 0.02
    ion_velocities = 'zero'

Label: Ion Minimization

Performs both damped phonon dynamics and electron damping. It is supposed
that atoms are located near equalibrium, that is interatomic forces are small 
(< 1 atomic units). If your system is far from equalibrium (forces > 1 atomic units)
you need to use steepest descent phonon dynamics.
    ion_dynamics = 'sd'

- Ions Randomization
    ion_dynamics = 'none'           # IONS, for each species
    tranp(1) = .TRUE.               
    amprp(1) = 0.02

Performs randomization of ions in case if your system is very close to equalibrium.

Notes:
    To be strict after ions randomization you should also do the "Electron Minimization" again

Label: Ions Randomization

- Electrons and Ions Quenching
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_velocities = 'zero'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'
    ion_velocities = 'zero'

Label: Electrons and Ions Quenching

- Electron and Ion Dynamics
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_temperature = 'not_controlled'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'

Notes:
    - First CP run of "Electron and Ion Dynamics" should be performed with

Label: Electron and Ion Dynamics

- Electron and Ion Dynamics with Nose Thermostat    # Essential
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_temperature = 'zero'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'
    ion_temperature = 'nose'
    tempw = 300
    fnosep = 60

Label: Electrons and Ions with Thermostat

Configuration Input
-------------------

- Can skip generation forms and copy and paste the configuration input

- Users cannot control parameters, these parameters are handled by VNF.
  Parameters are not filtered when user edits configuration input.



Example of Q2R filtering
------------------------

Say, user entered config file to the config form

&INPUT
    fildyn = hello
    zasr = 'crystal'
    flfrc = world
/

VNF knows that "fildyn" and "flfrc" are special parameters that need to be set
according to the system convention. They will be set to proper parameters even
if they are not present in the first place. When you click on the "Submit" button
you get the following config text:

&INPUT
    fildyn = '/home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf/data/qejobs/EYGFTV94/matdyn'
    zasr = 'crystal'
    flfrc = 'default.fc'
/
