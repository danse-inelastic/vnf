Introduction
============

.. This guide aims to help vnf developers understand the architecture of
.. vnf, and provide examples of a variety of ways to extend vnf.



This guide presents the essential concepts and principles used in VNF.
It will guide you through the road of learning and developing VNF.

System administrators please read :ref:`vnfsysadminguide`.



How to learn VNF development
----------------------------

There are two broad categories of developers for VNF. 
First are extension writers, who extend VNF to support new
computation engines, and requires only basic knowledge of python.
The second, VNF core developers, who develop the 
infrastructure of VNF, and provide more and more solid,
flexible, and convenient framework. 

In this guide, we start with 
:ref:`this introduction  <vnfdeveloperguide-introduction>`
in which you can get an overview of the organization
of the project, and then explain briefly
:ref:`the development philosophy <vnfdeveloperguide-philosophy>`
of VNF, which is very useful to get a first feeling
of the concepts and principles behind VNF development.
And then a few tutorials of extending VNF are presented to 
help you go through a few examples of extending VNF.

For VNF core developers, and all developers who are interested
in the details of the infastructure of VNF, the following
sections are useful materials covering details of various aspects 
of VNF, such as, for example,
its architecture, user interface framework, orm, and testing system.
