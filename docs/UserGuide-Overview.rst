Overview
========

Virtual neutron facility is a web service where you can plan 
and run virtual neutron experiments, 
and collect virtual experiment data for your virtual sample.
In a virtual neutron experiment, virtual neutrons are generated from a
virtual neutron source, guided by virtual neutron guides, scattered by
a virtual sample and sample environment, and intercepted by virtual detectors.

You can do your experiments on a variety of neutron instruments, both
actual physical instruments and conceptual instruments.

You can also create your sample and predict its neutron scattering
properties  by calculating its structure or dynamics. For example, the
material behaviors calculated by ab initio or molecular dynamics
methods become scattering kernels that can be used in the sample
simulation part of your virtual experiment.

On the left, several menu items link to a variety of functions. You
can review past experiments by clicking "Experiments", or browse your
personal library of samples by clicking "Samples". A library of
materials you and other researchers are interested are in the tab
"Atomic structures".
When you start a virtual experiment, or a material simulation, they
became computational jobs submitted to computing resources. 
You can monitor their progress by clicking "Jobs".
