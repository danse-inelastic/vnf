Tutorial: a virtual neutron experiment using phonon data calculated from BvK model
==================================================================================

In this tutorial, we will show step-by-step how to run a virtual neutron expriment
using a simple sample with coherent inelastic scattering from sample phonons
that are computed from a BvK model.

We start from log in.
