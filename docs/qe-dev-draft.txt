Directory Stucture
------------------

Root directory: /home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf stores VNF related data (not necessarily
job related data )

Working directory (stored in "servers" database): /home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf/data




Adding New Pseudo-Potential
---------------------------

Optimization
------------

When a user checks "Optimization" checkbox, the simulation will use scratch space
as it's temporary directory. Example:

/scratch/M56XLZEX

where 'M56XLZEX' is the id of qesimulations. The directories are created and 
never deleted by VNF. Though they can be cleaned up by system administrator
any time without any warning.

Job Submission
--------------
Steps of job submission:
- Create database record for job
- Copy configuration file from qeconfigurations to qejobs directory: self._storeConfigurations()
- Generate run.sh script and save in qejobs directory: self._createRunScript()
- Save extra file in qejobs directory (for "trajectory" task type): self._storeExtraFiles()
- Move files to remote directory (create if not exists): self._moveFiles()
- Submit job to queue: self._scheduleJob()


Configuration Generation
------------------------


Configuration Filtering
-----------------------

The purpose of filters is to make sure that some of the parameters are correctly
set, depending on system settings (e.g. parameter of simulation refers to the
correct location of previously run simulation)

- Filtering is done when the config file is created only
- There is no filtering when config file is edited!

Filters for QE are located in the directory:

vnfb/qeutils/filters/

You can edit filters that you think are appropriate

Chain of calls for config input generation
--------------------------------------------

Format of the sequence diagrams:

<short actor name>.<routine> (visual: <short visual name>) [<operation type>] ->

Example: generate-q2r.default (visual: input-q2r) [form] ->

"generate-q2r"  - short name for actor "material_simulations/espresso-utils/generate-q2r"
"default"       - routine called in the "generate-q2r" actor
"input-q2r"     - short name for visual "material_simulations/espresso/input-q2r"
                  there might be several visuals used for one actor
"form"          - Display form. Can be: "form", "redirect"
"->"            - Refers to the next call

Notes:
    - Base directory names can change, but they should be in one of the
      "material_simulations/espresso*/" directory.
