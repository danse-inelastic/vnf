Experiments
===========

In this tab, a table of virtual neutron experiments are presented.

Virtual neutron experiments are Monte Carlo simulations of neutron
experiments.
A virtual neutron experiment consists of a virtual neutron instrument,
a virtual sample (and possibly a sample environment), and other
user instructions of how this experiment is carried out.

In this table, you can create a new neutron experiment, look for
old neutron experiments, and also view their details and 
experiment results.

To see how to sort, filter, and how to use labels, please read
:ref:`the table view section <atomic-structures-tableview>` for 
:ref:`atomic structures <atomic-structures>` first. The basic 
functionalities of the table view here is the same as the one
for atomic structures.
