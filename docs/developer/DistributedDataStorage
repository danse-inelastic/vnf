Distributed data storage

Virtual neutron facility is intended for users to launch computational jobs on a distributed network of
resources. A particular job may be launched in one computing cluster, while another job that depends on this job
may be launched on another computing cluster.
(In the long run, a job itself might be running across several computing clusters.)
We need to be able to move data around easily among computing clusters.
The DistributedDataStorage is facility to provide an interface that allows VNF developers to 
do that easily.
The mechanism of data movement is hidden from developers, and should be automatically
determined from the available connections among computing clusters.

DistributedDataStorage has a very simple design.
It assumes that the same directory structure exists across several computing clusters,
and users of DistributedDataStorage will request moving data files from one cluster
to another by

 dds.make_availabe(filepath, cluster)
