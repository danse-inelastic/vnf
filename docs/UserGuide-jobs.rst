Jobs
====

In this tab, a table of **computational jobs** are presented.

A **computational job** will be created when a user finished 
configuring a **computation** and is ready to submit the computation
to a computing cluster.
Here a **computation** could be a simple modeling,
a sophisticated material simulation,
or a Monte Carlo simulation of neutron experiment.

After a **computational job** is created, it can be configured
and submitted to a computing cluster, and be monitored.
Its status can be found out in this tab. To find out more details
about a job, select it from the table to view its details.
