Scripting access to VNF
========================

VNF is based on a number of underlying components which are all easily accessible from a python scripting interface.  This allows not only for advanced users to create dynamic workflows without the need to wait for developers to construct a useful UI in the web portal, but it also allows new and potentially useful but untested portions of neutron scattering science to be cheaply included within VNF and more thoroughly scientifically grounded in the future while current users test and continue to develop them.
