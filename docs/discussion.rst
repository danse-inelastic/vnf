..which actually brings up another question: why do the attributes
not match the column names...and why does the class name not match the
table name...why the 's'?...

k...looks like the problem is you added 'base' to lattice db
table...hmmm...i still think the soln is importing a small subset of
db and marking up the lattice class directly rather than separating
out a separate class (although that is a move in the right
direction)...this would make it more obvious when such additions are
made to the rest of us...it wouldn't be hard to do, i think



VNF is a Virtual Neutron Scattering Facility to complement the SNS
