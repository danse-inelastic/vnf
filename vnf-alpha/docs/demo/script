explain main menus 
  here we are in the welcome page. it explains what we can do in this virtual neutron facility.
  we can start by creating a new neutron experiment, or review a list of existing neutron
  experiments we have either set up or run. 
start neutron experiment wizard
  Let us start by building a new neutron experiment using this wizard
input experiment name
  The first page of the experiment wizard explains what we need to do to set up a virtual
  neutron experiment. First we need to give this experiment a name.
select instrument  (ARCS)
  The next step is to select a neutron instrument where our experiment will be carried out.
  Currently we have two instruments for us to select; we will add more instruments here, 
  and we will allow us to build new neutron insturments in the future.
configure instrument
  We can configure the ARCS instrument by setting the incident neutron energy and 
  the resolution. (type in a wrong value (negative eneryg) to show the input-checking)
configure sample environment
  select sample? start java webstart
configure kernel
  ...
submit
  Now we are almost done. We just need to specify the number of neutrons to run and 
  the computation resources to use, then we can click "submit"
review and run
  THis page here is for us to review the neutron experiment you have set up. It is 
  presented now as a tree of information. We can go through the tree and make
  sure things are inputed correctly. WE can reconfigure the experiment if we found
  any errors. If everything is fine, we can now start the experiment.
result:
  The experiment is now running. The data generated from this experiment will gradually
  show up in this page when it is available.
