In addtion to ../../README, here are some additional things to do:

1. establish a ssh tunnel to make remote db access looks like local (this is necessary because the db server on octopod only allows local connections)

 $ ssh -L 54320:localhost:5432 linjiao@octopod

This should match "db" property in 
  config/clerk.pml

2. establish a ssh tunnel to a remote computation server (who is the default computing cluster)
Take a look at

  vnf/dom/Server.py

There is a default server there. The default server is assumed to be at localhost:54321. The default
server should have a "linjiao" account and a directory /home/linjiao/vnfjobs.
The default server should be using torque scheduler. 
Basically you need to look into the default server record in vnf/dom/Server.py to make sure
everything is correct.

To make the server available at localhost:54321, ssh tunneliing need to be used again.
