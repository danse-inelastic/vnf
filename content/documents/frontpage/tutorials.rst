* `bvk and virtual inelastic neutron experiment <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/Tutorial-bvk-to-experiment.html>`_

 Use Born-von Karman lattice dynamics simulation to obtain phonon
 density of states and phonon dispersions and use calculated phonons
 for an inelastic neutron scattering kernel in a virtual sample, and
 run a virtual experiment to obtain I(Q,E)

* `Quantum Espresso <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/qe-phonon-dos.html>`_

  Use Quantum Espresso to calculate electronic structure and phonon properties
  of a material including density of states and dispersion within the Density
  Functional Theory (DFT) approach. The results can be used to get I(Q,E) through
  VNF virtual experiment. Use the package also to perform convergence tests and
  Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculations.
