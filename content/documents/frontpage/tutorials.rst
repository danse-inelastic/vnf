* `bvk and virtual inelastic neutron experiment <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/Tutorial-bvk-to-experiment.html>`_

  Use Born-von Karman lattice dynamics simulation to obtain phonon
  density of states and phonon dispersions and use calculated phonons
  for an inelastic neutron scattering kernel in a virtual sample, and
  run a virtual experiment to obtain I(Q,E)

* `Quantum Espresso <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/qe-phonon-dos.html>`_

  Use Quantum Espresso to calculate electronic structure and phonon properties
  of a material including density of states and dispersion within the Density
  Functional Theory (DFT) approach. The results can be used to get I(Q,E) through
  VNF virtual experiment. Use the package also to perform convergence tests and
  Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics calculations.
  
* `Creating forcefield-physics dynamics and processing them into scattering and dynamical measurements <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/md-sqe.html>`_

  Use Gulp engine to create either phonon or md dynamics objects.  Use 'Analysis' tab to calculate
  S(Q,E), DOS, EISF, VACF, diffusion coefficient, etc. from the dynamics.
