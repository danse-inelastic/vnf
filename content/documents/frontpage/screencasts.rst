* `bvk and virtual inelastic neutron experiment
  <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/movies/matter-bvk-vexp.html>`_ (Mar 2010, 6 min)

  Use Born-von Karman lattice dynamics simulation to obtain phonon
  density of states and phonon dispersions and use calculated phonons
  for an inelastic neutron scattering kernel in a virtual sample, and
  run a virtual experiment to obtain I(Q,E)

* `Quantum Espresso <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/movies/qe.html>`_ (Mar 2010, 6 min)

  Use Quantum Espresso (QE) to calculate electronic structure and phonon properties
  of a material including density of states and dispersion within the Density
  Functional Theory (DFT) approach.
  
* `Forcefield simulation and S(Q,E) generation--setup (with audio) <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/movies/st_screencast.mov>`_ (Mar 2010, 8 min)

  Use AtomSim to do a full MD simulation using forcefields.  Input settings to compute
  an S(Q,E).
