How do I ...
------------

... use an atomic structure not yet in the atomic structure table when creating a (Quantum Espresso) simulation?
    You will need to go to the "atomic structure" tab, and create or import
    a new structure. Please click the "New" button at the top-right corner
    in the "atomic structure" tab, and follow the instructions there.
    Then you can go back to the "simulations" tab and start a new simulation.
