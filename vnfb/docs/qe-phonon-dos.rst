Phonon DOS Calculation Using Quantum Espresso with VNF
======================================================

Introduction
------------

In this short tutorial I will show the main steps of the workflow to calculate
phonon DOS using Quantum Espresso with VNF.

Create New Simulation
---------------------

There are two ways to create a new simulation. The first way is to go to the
“Simulations” section, click on the “New” green cross like button.
