Directory Stucture
------------------

Root directory: /home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf stores VNF related data (not necessarily
job related data )

Working directory (stored in "servers" database): /home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf/data

Adding New Pseudo-Potential
---------------------------

Optimization
------------

When a user checks "Optimization" checkbox, the simulation will use scratch space
as it's temporary directory. Example:

/scratch/M56XLZEX

where 'M56XLZEX' is the id of qesimulations. The directories are created and 
never deleted by VNF. Though they can be cleaned up by system administrator
any time without any warning.
