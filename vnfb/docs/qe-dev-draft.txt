Directory Stucture
------------------

Root directory: /home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf stores VNF related data (not necessarily
job related data )

Working directory (stored in "servers" database): /home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf/data




Adding New Pseudo-Potential
---------------------------

Optimization
------------

When a user checks "Optimization" checkbox, the simulation will use scratch space
as it's temporary directory. Example:

/scratch/M56XLZEX

where 'M56XLZEX' is the id of qesimulations. The directories are created and 
never deleted by VNF. Though they can be cleaned up by system administrator
any time without any warning.

Job Submission
--------------
Steps of job submission:
- Create database record for job
- Copy configuration file from qeconfigurations to qejobs directory: self._storeConfigurations()
- Generate run.sh script and save in qejobs directory: self._createRunScript()
- Save extra file in qejobs directory (for "trajectory" task type): self._storeExtraFiles()
- Move files to remote directory (create if not exists): self._moveFiles()
- Submit job to queue: self._scheduleJob()
