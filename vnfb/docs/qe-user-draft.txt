Results Path
------------
There are two types of result paths: local and remote. Local result path is available
when results are retrieved to the local machine only.


Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics
---------------------------------

"NVT" - Canonical ensemble with Nose Thermostat. At this point Quantum Espresso
within VNF does not directly support variable-cell molecular dynamics (or stress
calculation) - "NPT". But you are still can do variable-cell molecular dynamics
by editing files appropriately.

In order to caclculate CP molecular dynamics simulation you need to bring your system. 
to a particular state. The following steps are implemented:

- Electronic Minimization (with Fixed Ions and Cells) # Essential

    restart_mode = 'from_scratch'   # SYSTEM
    electron_dynamics = 'sd'        # ELECTRONS
    ion_dynamics = 'none'           # IONS

Label: Electronic Minimization

Performs steepest descent electron dynamics

- Ion Minimization (with Damped Electron Dynamics and Fixed Cells)

    restart_mode = 'restart'        # SYSTEM
    electron_dynamics = 'damp'      # ELECTRONS
    electron_damping = 0.2
    ion_dynamics = 'damp'           # IONS
    ion_damping = 0.02
    ion_velocities = 'zero'

Label: Ion Minimization

Performs both damped phonon dynamics and electron damping. It is supposed
that atoms are located near equalibrium, that is interatomic forces are small 
(< 1 atomic units). If your system is far from equalibrium (forces > 1 atomic units)
you need to use steepest descent phonon dynamics.
    ion_dynamics = 'sd'

- Ions Randomization
    ion_dynamics = 'none'           # IONS, for each species
    tranp(1) = .TRUE.               
    amprp(1) = 0.02

Performs randomization of ions in case if your system is very close to equalibrium.

Notes:
    To be strict after ions randomization you should also do the "Electron Minimization" again

Label: Ions Randomization

- Electrons and Ions Quenching
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_velocities = 'zero'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'
    ion_velocities = 'zero'

Label: Electrons and Ions Quenching

- Electron and Ion Dynamics
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_temperature = 'not_controlled'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'

Notes:
    - First CP run of "Electron and Ion Dynamics" should be performed with

Label: Electron and Ion Dynamics

- Electron and Ion Dynamics with Nose Thermostat    # Essential
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_temperature = 'zero'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'
    ion_temperature = 'nose'
    tempw = 300
    fnosep = 60

Configuration Input
-------------------

- Can skip generation forms and copy and paste the configuration input

- Users cannot control parameters, these parameters are handled by VNF:

    outdir  (**/qesimulations - NFS, /scratch - scratch space)
    prefix  (docs default values)

PH:
    fildyn (docs default value: 'matdyn')

Q2R (see doc in PH/q2r.f90):
    fildyn (path to PH fildyn directory), Example: '/home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf/data/qejobs/9DDA4RS/matdyn'
    flfrc  ('default.fc', not in docs default values) , Example: 'default.fc'

MATDYN (see doc in PH/matdyn.f90):
    flfrc   (path do Q2R flfrc directory), Example: '/home/danse-vnf-admin/vnf/data/qejobs/9S2EA6Z/default.fc'

    flfrq   (docs default value: 'matdyn.freq'),
    flvec   (docs default value: 'matdyn.modes'),
