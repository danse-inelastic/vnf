Scripting access to VNF
========================

VNF is based on a number of underlying components which are all easily accessible from a python scripting interface.  This allows not only for advanced users to create dynamic workflows without the need to wait for developers to construct a useful UI in the web portal, but it also allows new and potentially useful but untested portions of neutron scattering science to be cheaply included within VNF and more thoroughly scientifically grounded in the future while current users test and continue to develop them.

Download
==========

Currently the best way to script is directly from the svn repositories.  All relevant repositories, examples, and cookbook scripts (see below) maybe downloaded by::

	easy_install -U vnf

Example workflows
========================

A few example workflows are illustrated below to demonstrate the power of scripting within the VNF framework.

User Cookbook
========================

The scripting interface also allows users to develop "recipes" for accomplishing certain tasks and store them as scripts.  The following are links to some of these recipes:
