Computed properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The "computed properties" panel shows physical properties of
this atomic structure that were calculated using various computation 
techniuqes.

There are several sub-panels, each of which corresponds to one type
of physical property.


Phonons
!!!!!!!

This panel displays the phonon-related properties for the current
atomic structure.

* Phonon density of states
* Phonon dispersions
