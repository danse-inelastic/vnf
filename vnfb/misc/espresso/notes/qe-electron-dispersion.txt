# There are two ways to caclculate electron dispersion:
# 1. [PW] -> [PW] (with generated grid)
# 2. [PW] -> [PW] -> [BANDS] -> [PLOTBANDS]

# We can give option to user when it creates a new simulation and chooses simulation
type: "Electron Dispersion" as a subtype: "the Master's stuff", "QE stuff" (come up with the name)

# For now let implement option (2)

[PW]
# Same as in qe-electron-dos.txt

[PW]

[BANDS]
Form:
[Finish] ???

Configuration field:
[Finish] ???

[PLOTBANDS]
Form:

Emin (eV): [0]
Emax (eV): [25]
Delta E (eV): [0.1]


Configuration field:

{bands.dat}
{Emin} {Emax}
{bands.xmgr}
{bands.ps}
{Efermi}
{DeltaE} {Efermi}

Electron Dispersion
-------------------
(from plotbands)

# In the future: Add Isosurface (for option (1))

Electron Isosurface
