Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics uses cp.x binary. Some runs are performed to prepare
system to a particular state, some perform actual molecular dynamics. 
cppp.x binary performs postprocessing and basically just processes the
trajectories provided by CP simulation and extracts them in a more convenient form.
I can do the parsing by myself.

User goes to "Create New Simulation" page and selects "Molecular Dynamics", the
following steps show up in the end.

Steps:
    [x] Electronic Minimization # Essential (Tip: With Fixed Ions and Cells)
    [ ] Ion Minimization (Tip: With Damped Electron Dynamics and Fixed Cells)
    [ ] Ions Randomization
    [ ] Electrons and Ions Quenching
    [ ] Electron and Ion Dynamics
    [x] Electron and Ion Dynamics with Nose Thermostat

Types:
    electron-min,ion-min,ion-random,quenching,dynamics,thermostat,trajectory

Description:

- Electronic Minimization (with Fixed Ions and Cells) # Essential

    restart_mode = 'from_scratch'   # SYSTEM
    electron_dynamics = 'sd'        # ELECTRONS
    ion_dynamics = 'none'           # IONS

Label: Electronic Minimization

Performs steepest descent electron dynamics

- Ion Minimization (with Damped Electron Dynamics and Fixed Cells)

    restart_mode = 'restart'        # SYSTEM
    electron_dynamics = 'damp'      # ELECTRONS
    electron_damping = 0.2
    ion_dynamics = 'damp'           # IONS
    ion_damping = 0.02
    ion_velocities = 'zero'

Label: Ion Minimization

Performs both damped phonon dynamics and electron damping. It is supposed
that atoms are located near equalibrium, that is interatomic forces are small
(< 1 atomic units). If your system is far from equalibrium (forces > 1 atomic units)
you need to use steepest descent phonon dynamics.
    ion_dynamics = 'sd'

- Ions Randomization
    ion_dynamics = 'none'           # IONS, for each species
    tranp(1) = .TRUE.
    amprp(1) = 0.02

Performs randomization of ions in case if your system is very close to equalibrium.

Notes:
    To be strict after ions randomization you should also do the "Electron Minimization" again

Label: Ions Randomization

- Electrons and Ions Quenching
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_velocities = 'zero'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'
    ion_velocities = 'zero'

Label: Electrons and Ions Quenching

- Electron and Ion Dynamics
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_temperature = 'not_controlled'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'

Notes:
    - First CP run of "Electron and Ion Dynamics" should be performed with

Label: Electron and Ion Dynamics

- Electron and Ion Dynamics with Nose Thermostat    # Essential
    electron_dynamics = 'verlet'
    electron_temperature = 'zero'
    ion_dynamics = 'verlet'
    ion_temperature = 'nose'
    tempw = 300
    fnosep = 60

Label: Electrons and Ions with Thermostat
