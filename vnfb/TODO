Establish a suite of tests to make sure that vnf is running correctly.
This would be useful, for example, when vnf vm is restarted.

Also make a test script for testing if a computing cluster is live  
 * ssh connection (or other connection)
 * cluster status daemon
 * job scheduler script (torque for example)
 * mpi daemon
 * test if any of the computing engine is available
THis script probably is best written with facilities in pathos.

Problem: How to define similarity for simulation tasks? Settings? Matter?
Solution:

- Move some of the qe stuff from vnfb/vnfb/utils -> vnfb/content/components/visuals
 because they look like visuals :)
- Do not display action buttons "Run Task" or "Cancel" unless previous simulation
    is running or completed
- Change action buttom depending on the status of the job:
    "Run Task" -> "Cancel" -> "Run Task"
- Change status of jobs depending on scheduling steps


*********** TODO Steps **************
1. [DONE] Run simulation with vnf created bash script (no qeapp.py)
2. [DONE] Get results with "Check" link
3. Make "Status" string and action buttons ("Run Task", "Cancel") work properly
4. Hook up QECalc (use qeapp.py)
5. Display simulation results (make "Analyze" working)


*** Alpha Release of QE simulations ***
- Disable option to run several jobs for one task or use existing task in simulation
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with computation nodes on cluster and
settings handling.
- Disable option to change simulation type 
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with dereferencing simulation tasks
