High priority
-------------
 * phonons data object: read/write different formats...  need to think
   of how make_available can work better for multiple data formats...
 * analytical sqe model
 * DetectorSytemFromXML component
 * Nuetron recorder, player



Front page
----------



Misc.
-----
 * The "collapsed" document need a small tiny document body to look better


Master tables
------------
 * delete button



Job
---
 * job view page



Neutron experiment
------------------
 * revise neutron experiment wizard (to make it more graphic and more
   intuitive)
* fixed the bug that happens when selecting neutron storage and there
  is no storage records in the system


Atomicstructure
---------------
 * link to create sample from atomicstructure page
 * panels for SQE, samples, experiments



Kernels
-------
* Phonon kernel: should be able to take polarizations as numpy array
  of complex numbers


More long term 
--------------

Help system

Establish a suite of tests to make sure that vnf is running correctly.
This would be useful, for example, when vnf vm is restarted.

Also make a test script for testing if a computing cluster is live  
 * ssh connection (or other connection)
 * cluster status daemon
 * job scheduler script (torque for example)
 * mpi daemon
 * test if any of the computing engine is available
THis script probably is best written with facilities in pathos.
