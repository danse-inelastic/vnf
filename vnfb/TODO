Help system

Establish a suite of tests to make sure that vnf is running correctly.
This would be useful, for example, when vnf vm is restarted.

Also make a test script for testing if a computing cluster is live  
 * ssh connection (or other connection)
 * cluster status daemon
 * job scheduler script (torque for example)
 * mpi daemon
 * test if any of the computing engine is available
THis script probably is best written with facilities in pathos.
