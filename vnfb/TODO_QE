 TODO List for Quantum Espresso
==============================

NOW
===

Part 1
------
- [DONE] Implement scratch space
- [DONE] Handle important parameters (e.g. outdir, prefix ...) so that users could run simulations using example
  config files
    Problematic types: MATDYN, DYNMAT, Q2R
- [DONE] Able to skip generator forms: "Skip Input Generator"
- [DONE] Add "Explain" link to simulation edit
- Implement progress bar for results
- [IN PROGRESS] Add "octopod" server and implement module that handles server configurations
  and settings


Part 2
------
- Convergence tests
- Simulation Clone
- Simulation Delete
- Delete Job(s)


Part 3
------
- Storing optimized structure to atomic structure
- Don't allow to set config input unless the previous config input is set


Part 4
-------
Molecular Dynamics:
- Implement converters for molecular dynamics:
    scripts/nc2dos.py
    scripts/qe2dos.py
    scripts/qe2nc.py

- Implement display of major trajectory parameters for each task: VDOS, 
- Implement convenient selection of time frame
- Create trajectory and store it to the database (including charge?)


Part 5
------
- Implement batch job submission
- Implement status bar for batch job submission
- Fix status bar


Part 6
------
Go through the types of simulation and make sure they work as they should:

- Electron Structure
- Electron DOS
- Electron Dispersion
- Geometry Optimization
- Single Phonon
- Multiple Phonon
- Molecular Dynamics

- Test filters for task types: 
    "pw", "ph", "q2r", "dos", "dynmat", "matdyn", "bands", "plotband", "cp"


Part 7
------
- Write documentation for QE [MUST]
- Write implementation notes for developers [MUST]
- Write documentation for qeinput and make it a python egg
- Add link next to the plot to download the DOS file. Open the file in a new browser window.
- Add links to documentation for QE (inputs: pw, ph, q2r).
- [IN PROGRESS] Format text for some tesk types (e.g. q2r doc is in PH/q2r.f90 file of espresso source code)
    Note: Could not find docs for "plotband" task type


Part 8: Cleaning
----------------
- Implement PLOTBAND filter (non-standard config file)
- Fix plot sizes on analysis page (see vnf.css: .luban-plot2d)
- Delete directory when configuration is deleted


Part 9: TeraGrid
-------------------------------------------
- Add TeraGrid to the list of servers


Issues:
- Was thinking about definition of failed job for QE. Currently, when CRASH file
exists, it marked as failed. But sometimes when STDERR.log is not empty, but no
CRASH file job can also be failed. Add check is STDERR.log is not empty? The reason
why not add this check at this time is that there might be warnings that are
system related and nothing user can do about it.

Problem: How to define similarity for simulation tasks? Settings? Matter?
Solution:


Simulation Types
================

- Electron Structure
- Electron DOS
- Electron Dispersion
- Geometry Optimization
- Single Phonon
- Multiple Phonon (1. On-host run)
- Molecular Dynamics


Nice To Have
============

- [PARTIALLY] Move some of the qe stuff from vnfb/vnfb/utils -> vnfb/content/components/visuals
 because they look like visuals :)


Must Have
=========
    NONE


CRITICAL FIXES
==============
    NONE


COMPLETED
=========

- [DONE] Generate QE config file from atomic structure
- [DONE] Add progress bar for jobs with steps description
- [DONE] Move "servers" reference from qesimulations to qesettings
- [DONE] Dialog widget
- [DONE] Implement Filter class in qeinput
- [DONE] Update qeinput interface and write unit tests!
- [DONE] Finish up the qeinput!
- [DONE] Figure out what diskspace the QE is currently using. In case of NFS measure the performace
        degradation in comparison with scratch space
- [DONE] Sanityze input file for qe simulations from Windows carriage return ('\15\32')
    See:
        http://kb.iu.edu/data/data/acux.html
        Command: awk '{ sub("\r$", ""); print }' winfile.txt > unixfile.txt
- [DONE] Recognize elements and populate psedo potentials depending on the elements in the structure
    (see input-pw.odb visual)
- [DONE] Handle multiple jobs for the task
- [DONE] Fix database jobs status depending on the actual jobs status
- [DONE] Fix the formatting of config view and create
- [DONE] Display and refresh output file
- [DONE] Display simulation results and plot with
- [DONE] Fix retrieving results again (fix getmtime.py)
- [DONE] Run "Multiple Phonon" simulation
- [DONE] Run "Single Phonon" simulation
- [DONE] Phonon DOS ("Analyze" button)
- [DONE] Phonon Dispersion ("Analyze" button)
- [DONE] Generate QE config file from atomic structure !!!
- [DONE] Update only simulation task field (revise visuals)
- [DONE] Run simulation with vnf created bash script (no qeapp.py)
- [DONE] Get results with "Check" link
- [DONE] Make "Status" string and action buttons ("Run Task", "Cancel", "Run Task Again") work properly
- [DONE] Hook up QECalc (use qeapp.py?)
- [DONE] Do not display action buttons "Run Task" or "Cancel" unless previous simulation
    is running or completed
- [DONE] Change action buttom depending on the status of the job:
    "Run Task" -> "Cancel" -> "Run Task"


*** Alpha Release of QE simulations ***
- Disable option to use existing task in simulation
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with computation nodes on cluster and
settings handling.
- Disable option to change simulation type (?)
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with dereferencing simulation tasks
