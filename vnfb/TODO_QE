TODO List for Quantum Espresso
==============================

Problem: How to define similarity for simulation tasks? Settings? Matter?
Solution:

Nice To Have
============

- Move some of the qe stuff from vnfb/vnfb/utils -> vnfb/content/components/visuals
 because they look like visuals :)
- Do not display action buttons "Run Task" or "Cancel" unless previous simulation
    is running or completed
- Change action buttom depending on the status of the job:
    "Run Task" -> "Cancel" -> "Run Task"

Must Have
=========

- Generate QE config file from atomic structure

NOW
===

- [PART] Display simulation results and plot with 
- [DONE] Fix retrieving results again (fix getmtime.py)
- Run "Multiple Phonon" simulation
- Run "Single Phonon" simulation
- Phonon DOS ("Analyze" button)
- Phonon Dispersion ("Analyze" button)
- Add progress bar for jobs with steps description
- Generate QE config file from atomic structure !!!


CRITICAL FIXES
==============
- Recognize elements and populate psedo potentials depending on the elements in the structure
    (see input-pw.odb visual)
- Don't allow to set config input unless the previous config input is set

- Handle multiple jobs for the task
- Fix database jobs status depending on the actual jobs status
- Fix the formatting of config view and create

- Display and refresh output file
- Hide "Run Task" button unless the previous simulation task is completed
- Display jobs


BUGS
====
director.redirect() does not always pass parameters

Simulations Types [Status]
=================
[IN PROGRESS] Electron Structure
- Electron DOS
- Electron Dispersion
- Geometry Optimization
- Single Phonon
- Multiple Phonon (1. On-host run)

Minor:
- Update only simulation task field (revise visuals)


TODO Steps
==========

1. [DONE] Run simulation with vnf created bash script (no qeapp.py)
2. [DONE] Get results with "Check" link
3. Make "Status" string and action buttons ("Run Task", "Cancel", "Run Task Again") work properly
4. Hook up QECalc (use qeapp.py?)


*** Alpha Release of QE simulations ***
- Disable option to use existing task in simulation
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with computation nodes on cluster and
settings handling.
- Disable option to change simulation type (?)
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with dereferencing simulation tasks
