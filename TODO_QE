TODO List for Quantum Espresso
==============================

NOW
===

Part 1
------
- [DONE] Implement scratch space
- [DONE] Handle important parameters (e.g. outdir, prefix ...) so that users could run simulations using example
  config files
    Problematic types: MATDYN, DYNMAT, Q2R

- [DONE] Able to skip generator forms: "Skip Input Generator"
- [DONE] Add "Explain" link to simulation edit
- Implement progress bar for results
- Add "octopod" server and implement module that handles server configurations
  and settings


Part 2
------
- Convergence tests
- Simulation Clone
- Simulation Delete
- Delete Job(s)


Part 3
------
- Storing optimized structure to atomic structure
- Don't allow to set config input unless the previous config input is set


Part 4
-------
Molecular Dynamics:
- Implement converters for molecular dynamics:
    scripts/nc2dos.py
    scripts/qe2dos.py
    scripts/qe2nc.py

- Implement display of major trajectory parameters for each task: VDOS, 
- Implement convenient selection of time frame
- Create trajectory and store it to the database (including charge?)


Part 5
------
- Implement batch job submission
- Fix status bar


Part 6
------
Go through the types of simulation and make sure they work as they should:

- Electron Structure
- Electron DOS
- Electron Dispersion
- Geometry Optimization
- Single Phonon
- Multiple Phonon
- Molecular Dynamics

- Test filters for task types: 
    "pw", "ph", "q2r", "dos", "dynmat", "matdyn", "bands", "plotband", "cp"


Part 7
------
- Write documentation for QE [MUST]
- Write implementation notes for developers [MUST]
- Write documentation for qeinput and make it a python egg
- Add link next to the plot to download the DOS file. Open the file in a new browser window.
- Add links to documentation for QE (inputs: pw, ph, q2r).
- [IN PROGRESS] Format text for some tesk types (e.g. q2r doc is in PH/q2r.f90 file of espresso source code)
    Note: Could not find docs for "plotband" task type


Part 8: Cleaning
----------------
- Implement PLOTBAND filter (non-standard config file)
- Fix plot sizes on analysis page (see vnf.css: .luban-plot2d)
- Delete directory when configuration is deleted


Problem: How to define similarity for simulation tasks? Settings? Matter?
Solution:


Simulation Types
================

- Electron Structure
- Electron DOS
- Electron Dispersion
- Geometry Optimization
- Single Phonon
- Multiple Phonon (1. On-host run)
- Molecular Dynamics


Nice To Have
============

- [PARTIALLY] Move some of the qe stuff from vnfb/vnfb/utils -> vnfb/content/components/visuals
 because they look like visuals :)


Must Have
=========
    NONE


CRITICAL FIXES
==============
    NONE


COMPLETED
=========

- [DONE] Generate QE config file from atomic structure
- [DONE] Add progress bar for jobs with steps description
- [DONE] Move "servers" reference from qesimulations to qesettings
- [DONE] Dialog widget
- [DONE] Implement Filter class in qeinput
- [DONE] Update qeinput interface and write unit tests!
- [DONE] Finish up the qeinput!
- [DONE] Figure out what diskspace the QE is currently using. In case of NFS measure the performace
        degradation in comparison with scratch space
- [DONE] Sanityze input file for qe simulations from Windows carriage return ('\15\32')
    See:
        http://kb.iu.edu/data/data/acux.html
        Command: awk '{ sub("\r$", ""); print }' winfile.txt > unixfile.txt
- [DONE] Recognize elements and populate psedo potentials depending on the elements in the structure
    (see input-pw.odb visual)
- [DONE] Handle multiple jobs for the task
- [DONE] Fix database jobs status depending on the actual jobs status
- [DONE] Fix the formatting of config view and create
- [DONE] Display and refresh output file
- [DONE] Display simulation results and plot with
- [DONE] Fix retrieving results again (fix getmtime.py)
- [DONE] Run "Multiple Phonon" simulation
- [DONE] Run "Single Phonon" simulation
- [DONE] Phonon DOS ("Analyze" button)
- [DONE] Phonon Dispersion ("Analyze" button)
- [DONE] Generate QE config file from atomic structure !!!
- [DONE] Update only simulation task field (revise visuals)
- [DONE] Run simulation with vnf created bash script (no qeapp.py)
- [DONE] Get results with "Check" link
- [DONE] Make "Status" string and action buttons ("Run Task", "Cancel", "Run Task Again") work properly
- [DONE] Hook up QECalc (use qeapp.py?)
- [DONE] Do not display action buttons "Run Task" or "Cancel" unless previous simulation
    is running or completed
- [DONE] Change action buttom depending on the status of the job:
    "Run Task" -> "Cancel" -> "Run Task"


*** Alpha Release of QE simulations ***
- Disable option to use existing task in simulation
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with computation nodes on cluster and
settings handling.
- Disable option to change simulation type (?)
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with dereferencing simulation tasks
