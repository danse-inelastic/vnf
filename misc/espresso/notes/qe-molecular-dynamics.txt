Molecular dynamics calculations
===============================

- Phonon DOS
- S(Q,E)        # After DANSE meeting

Chain:
cp.x

CP molecular dynamics uses cp.x. I don't see much value in cppp.x

Available steps:
- Electronic minimization (with fixed ions and cells)
- Ions randomization
- Geometry optimization

The schema looks like:
[Step 1. Electronic ground state] -> [Step 2. Molecular Dynamics] -> [Step 3. DOS from Trajectory Analysis]

TODO:

1. Converter from velocity/position to NetCDF format (MMTK format) for nMOLDYN
2. 


Form for Step 1
---------------



Form for Step 2
---------------


Form for Step 3
---------------

Notes:
    - Trajectory to netCDF format conversion seems to be correct (See: qe2nmol.py)!
