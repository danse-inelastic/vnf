Q2R

  !     fildyn     :  input file name (character, must be specified)
  !                   "fildyn"0 contains information on the q-point grid
  !                   "fildyn"1-N contain force constans C_n = C(q_n)
  !                   for n=1,...N, where N is the number of q-points
  !                   in the irreducible brillouin zone
  !                   Normally this should be the same as specified
  !                   on input to the phonon code
  !     flfrc      :  output file containing the IFC in real space
  !                   (character, must be specified)
  !     zasr       :  Indicates type of Acoustic Sum Rules used for the Born
  !                   effective charges (character):
  !                   - 'no': no Acoustic Sum Rules imposed (default)
  !                   - 'simple':  previous implementation of the asr used
  !                     (3 translational asr imposed by correction of
  !                     the diagonal elements of the force-constants matrix)
  !                   - 'crystal': 3 translational asr imposed by optimized
  !                      correction of the IFC (projection).
  !                   - 'one-dim': 3 translational asr + 1 rotational asr
  !                     imposed by optimized correction of the IFC (the
  !                     rotation axis is the direction of periodicity; it
  !                     will work only if this axis considered is one of
  !                     the cartesian axis).
  !                   - 'zero-dim': 3 translational asr + 3 rotational asr
  !                     imposed by optimized correction of the IFC.
  !                   Note that in certain cases, not all the rotational asr
  !                   can be applied (e.g. if there are only 2 atoms in a
  !                   molecule or if all the atoms are aligned, etc.).
  !                   In these cases the supplementary asr are cancelled
  !                   during the orthonormalization procedure (see below).
  !
  !  If a file "fildyn"0 is not found, the code will ignore variable "fildyn"
  !  and will try to read from the following cards the missing information
  !  on the q-point grid and file names:
  !     nr1,nr2,nr3:  dimensions of the FFT grid formed by the q-point grid
  !     nfile      :  number of files containing C(q_n), n=1,nfile
  !  followed by nfile cards:
  !     filin      :  name of file containing C(q_n)
  !  The name and order of files is not important as long as q=0 is the first
