Establish a suite of tests to make sure that vnf is running correctly.
This would be useful, for example, when vnf vm is restarted.

Also make a test script for testing if a computing cluster is live  
 * ssh connection (or other connection)
 * cluster status daemon
 * job scheduler script (torque for example)
 * mpi daemon
 * test if any of the computing engine is available
THis script probably is best written with facilities in pathos.


*** Quantum Espresso ***
Problem: How to define similarity for simulation tasks?
Solution:

Alpha release of QE simulations:
- Disable option to run several jobs for one task or use existing task in simulation
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with computation nodes on cluster and
settings handling.
- Disable option to change simulation type 
    Reason: involves complexity in dealing with dereferencing simulation tasks
